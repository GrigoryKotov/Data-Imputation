The aim of this mini-project is to develop a machine learning project to impute the missing values of one variable (size) based on the other data available.

1. Develop an algorithm to impute the missing values of `size`.
2. Provide quantitative measures of the quality of the imputation.
3. Quantify the degree of confidence for each imputation.
